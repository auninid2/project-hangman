    "# How the solver works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load a dictionary of words. The file can be either:\n",
    "   - a plain list of words (one per line) or\n",
    "   - a Python dict where the keys are words.\n",
    "2. Pick a random secret word from the dictionary.\n",
    "3. Initialize game state:\n",
    "   - pattern: the current known letters for example T___E for \"table\"\n",
    "   - guessed: the set of letters already guessed\n",
    "   - candidates: dictionary words that match the secret's length and letter count\n",
    "4. Iterate guesses:\n",
    "   - Compute positional letter frequencies from remaining candidates\n",
    "   - Select the most likely letter (highest positional score). If no clear choice exists, pick a random unguessed letter\n",
    "5. Update state after each guess:\n",
    "   - If the guess is correct, reveal matching positions and filter candidates to match the updated pattern\n",
    "   - If the guess is incorrect, increment the wrong-guess counter and remove candidates containing that letter\n",
    "6. Repeat until the word is solved or the maximum allowed wrong guesses is reached\n",
    "7. Return the result (solved or failed) and statistics such as steps and incorrect guesses"
